The greatest landscape-level spillover risk occurs when regenerating and cleared habitats have high spillover risk, and secondary forest slowly regains attributes of mature forest.","We found that land-use history influences the trajectory of spillover risk through time. When the initial landscape is mostly mature forest, landscape-level spillover risk initially peaks then falls as cleared land, which has the highest spillover risk, is created and subsequently lost to urbanization and reforestation (figure 2a).",NA,NA,"Here, we present a general modelling framework to explore the potential consequences of land-use change on zoonotic disease spillover risk. We acknowledge that this framework is a simplification, and that multiple ecological processes will influence disease spillover in any system [26,27]. Data scarcity often limits our ability to parameterize complex models related to disease transmission [28,29]. Here, we acknowledge this limitation and simplify the representation of disease transmission dynamics. Predicting future spillover risk under ongoing land-use change is challenging due to uncertainties associated with future deforestation and reforestation patterns, as well as the specific types of forests that will regrow [30,31]. Our results highlight the importance of considering the potential consequences of land-use change for disease spillover risk.

For example, deforestation has created new breeding sites in the forested areas of Central West Africa [Walsh et al, 1993]. Where sunlight is able to penetrate the forest canopy and human activity has resulted in surface water pooling (e.g., tire ruts along roadsides), the favored habitat of An. gambiae s.l. is created. The building and expansion of towns and cities has resulted in a reduction of the disease in endemic areas as Anopheles vectors generally fail to breed in the frequently polluted waters of urban areas [Robert et al, 2003]. These results led to speculation that deforestation and regional rainfall decline were changing the environment in favor of conditions that savannah species of S. damnosum s.l. might prefer [Walsh et al., 1993]. Thus, in this example deforestation results in a change in services because vegetation cover, which regulates the amount of sunlight, is decreased. This change will result in an increase in sunlight penetration to the surface. If this surface consists of whitewater rapids, it can, in turn, result in the creation of suitable breeding sites for savannah blackfly vectors which otherwise spurn shaded water sources.

In fact, biodiversity under some circumstances can theoretically increase disease in humans (Keesing, Holt, and Ostfeld 2006). The extent to which biodiversity and the dilution affect is associated with disease prevalence is not well understood in a variety of disease systems and is an area of active research. There may be zoonotic infections that are not affected by levels of biodiversity, or only affected by certain threshold levels. To date, most studies of disease systems show that increasing biodiversity is more likely to dilute disease rather than to amplify it, but one should be cautious in applying dilution theory to specific disease systems without evidence. Furthermore, the principles of network science would anticipate that the relationship between biodiversity and disease prevalence might be nonlinear. However, in the case of Lyme disease, and for other infectious diseases, the reservoir species that are best at infecting vectors also tend to be the species that remain, or even thrive, as biodiversity is lost, whereas those less able to transmit pathogen tend to disappear (Keesing et al. 2010; Ostfeld and Holt 2004). Finally, suburbanization is a factor in the emergence and increasing incidence of Lyme disease. White-footed mice succeed in diverse habitats, from urban to rural, and because of their adaptability are considered ecological generalists. Their adaptive advantage makes them highly abundant in ecosystems in which habitats are fragmented and food, climate, or other essential resources are too variable to support other species that may have more specific needs. Although, overall, more trees are alive in New England than at any point since colonists arrived, New England’s forests are fragmented with roads, buildings, farms, suburban tracts, and other development that limit the extent and integrity of habitats. Larger forest fragments tend to support greater species diversity and reduce the relative abundance of white-footed mice in comparison to less competent, or incompetent, spirochetal reservoirs. As species are lost and biodiversity decreases, white-footed mice are represented in higher numbers compared with other species (Nupp and Swihart 1998). Both the overall density of nymphal ticks and the density of nymphal Ixodes ticks harboring Borrelia spirochetes are inversely related to forest patch size (Allan, Keesing, and Ostfeld 2003). Conversely, white-footed mice represent a smaller proportion of animals in a species-rich environment. And given that the whitefooted mouse is the principal natural reservoir for Lyme disease spirochetes and a highly competent host for blacklegged ticks, the addition of other less competent or incompetent hosts “dilutes” the representation of the mouse population, and a smaller proportion of ticks will be expected to carry Borrelia spirochetes.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Medium,,Medium,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

","""Patterns of human-wildlife contact and wild meat hunting in tropical peatlands provide further potential for disease spill-over events (during which a pathogen from one species moves into another) from wildlife to humans to occur. Human population density in tropical peatland areas is typically not high (e.g. Peru: Lilleskov et al., 2019; Congo Basin: Dargie et al., 2019), but some large population centres are found close to TPSF (e.g. Jambi and Palangka Raya, Indonesia; North and South Selangor, Malaysia; Iquitos, Peru; Fig. 2), and certain human activities increase contact between people and potential animal vectors in TPSF. Wildlife harvesting for consumption and trade is common in tropical forest nations (Fa, Currie & Meeuwig, 2003; Nielsen et al., 2018), including in TPSF areas. For example, in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, Pteropus vampyrus (Linn.) fruit bats are captured in TPSF areas and transported to local markets for sale as wild meat (Harrison et al., 2011). High contact levels between bats, hunters and vendors occur, with hunters and vendors frequently bitten and most bites drawing blood, raising concerns regarding potential zoonotic disease transmission (Harrison et al., 2011), though recent anecdotal observations suggest that local demand and trade has decreased as a likely result of the pandemic (R. Dwi et al., 2020, personal communication). Other species are commonly harvested for commercial trade in tropical peatland nations, often for sale in dense population areas, including turtles (Schoppe, 2009) and primates (Nijman et al., 2015) in Indonesia; plus pangolins and numerous other species from across South-east Asia (Nijman, 2010). Similar unsustainable hunting has been reported in the Congo Basin (Fa, Currie & Meeuwig, 2003; Poulsen et al., 2009). In the Peruvian Amazon TPSF, tapirs (Tapirus terrestris, Linn.), primates, rodents and other mammals are commonly hunted by local communities (Schulz et al., 2019a). Although there is some wildlife export to local market centres (e.g. Iquitos: Bodmer & Lozano, 2001; Mayor et al., 2019), most is consumed at a household level and constitutes an important protein source (Schulz et al., 2019a), providing higher potential to limit wildlife export from peatland areas than may be the case in South-east Asia and Africa. High densities of domestic and semi-wild animals reared on peatlands could also serve as a direct or indirect zoonotic EID vector to humans. For instance, in Indonesia, over 1.8 million chickens are kept in the predominantly peatland municipality of Palangka Raya (Statistics of Palangka Raya Municipality, 2018), while large numbers of naturally cave-roosting edible-nest swiftlets (mostly Aerodramus spp.) are reared in special buildings in many peatland areas, with most nests exported to China (Husson et al., 2018; Koon & Cranbrook, 2014; Thorburn, 2014).""","""Tropical peatland communities are commonly not food self-sufficient and tend to be close to poverty at the best of times (Wildayana & Armanto, 2018). Global food shortages due to COVID-19 may have implications for the price of imported food, increasing pressure on these communities and potentially forcing some into poverty (as feared more generally by key international institutions: Sánchez-Páramo, 2020; World Food Programme, 2020). Small-scale settler communities cultivating short-lifecycle food crops and staples serving local markets are likely to be less adversely affected, because demand for their output is relatively inelastic and close market proximity means they are better placed to respond to changes in local demand by rapidly switching production. To date, prices of such crops are indeed remaining relatively stable (Lucas, 2020), although some increases are anticipated (Amanta & Aprilianti, 2020). For such producers, the greater problem may be changes in the price of agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilisers) and other imported goods.""","""recognising that our assessment is both preliminary and likely incomplete owing to the recent emergence and rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic""","""Our review indicates that sustainable management and conservation of tropical peatlands is important for mitigating the impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic, while avoiding further encroachment into these ecosystems and intensive harvesting of their wildlife could reduce the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence and severity (summarised in Fig. 1)."" ""To our knowledge, this link between tropical peatland ecosystems and zoonotic EIDs has not been specifically noted previously and this therefore represents an important finding in terms of our understanding of the benefits that these ecosystems provide, thus strengthening the argument for their conservation and sustainable use.""","1. Field projects should support frontline team members to reduce their COVID-19 exposure risk and, thus, the risk of them infecting other community members and of work being impacted through worker infection. In addition to ensuring and facilitating adherence to current government and WHO guidelines, specific recommendations have been proposed for fire-fighters (Moore et al., 2020), and work with great apes (IUCN SSC WHSG & PSG SGA, 2020) and in their habitats (IUCN SSC PSG SGA, 2020). Development of similar specific guidelines for other sectors relating to tropical peatland management could be beneficial.  2. All actors should support local communities in and around tropical peatland areas to resolve land tenure conflicts and promote sustainable community-led management (Blackman et al., 2017; Santika et al., 2017), facilitate locally-derived sustainable economy development (Pearson et al., 2020), and prevent external users from unsustainably exploiting these ecosystems. This includes encouraging, and where necessary opening up new, discussions regarding the relationships between use of and encroachment into tropical peatlands, commercial vs. subsistence wildlife harvesting, and zoonotic EID risk, and considering these holistically in the context of community wellbeing and aspirations (cf. Kavousi et al., 2020). It should also include re-orientating discussions, from conservation and development organisations approaching with a perspective of ‘how can we help them’ to an approach of ‘we’re all in this together, so what can we each bring to the table to help?.’ Such re-orientations should ideally be informed by fresh social research on how communities’ lives, relations and experiences have been impacted by COVID-19, as these are unlikely to simply revert to a pre-pandemic ‘normal’. 3. The peatland research community should rethink approaches to research in at-risk communities, to potentially incorporate more remote and online working, plus enhanced roles for local research teams. This may require re-appraising how likely increasingly limited research resources are distributed, and particularly supporting local research capacity development and local researcher empowerment within international collaborations. Incorporating and centering local knowledge and priorities from the outset has the additional benefit of increasing the success of conservation and development interventions (Mistry & Berardi, 2016). COVID-19 has forced increased use of online communications tools and we hope this can help foster new patterns of international collaboration that further empower local researchers. See Lupton (2020) for an extensive list of potential approaches to reducing COVID-19 risk during social science fieldwork. 4. Wherever possible and working within all relevant government and sector COVID-19 guidelines, research, conservation and community projects should continue collection of long-term monitoring data and initiate repeat data collection to provide before-and-after comparisons, in order to help assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to the issues discussed in this paper. This may include, for example, patrol team or satellite data monitoring to assess if forest incursions or fire incidence have increased, or community livelihood data to assess if livelihood choices have changed and if/how this has impacted local wellbeing. It should also include collecting baseline human and wildlife community health information to better understand, monitor and thus mitigate zoonotic EID risk in tropical peatland areas. 5. Policy makers in tropical peatland areas should ensure that their policy decisions do not amplify the risks of the COVID-19 or potential future pandemics. In particular, any weakening of environmental and social standards and regulations relating to tropical peatlands should be avoided (see also Evers et al., 2017; Wijedasa et al., 2017). Instead, we recommend development and implementation of a ‘One Health/Ecohealth’ approach in tropical peatland nations, which recognises and supports the complex, mutually-beneficial interconnections among the health of people, animals, plants and our shared environment (El Zowalaty & Järhult, 2020; Hockings et al., 2020; Roger et al., 2016; UNEP & ILRI, 2020). We further recommend strengthening communications infrastructure in (remote) tropical peatland areas, to help minimise any impacts of reduced travel or on-the-ground activities in these areas. 6. Funders should exercise maximum possible flexibility to tropical peatland research, conservation and community projects impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including regarding achieving deliverable targets and deadlines, where possible offering additional support to maintain local staff employment during periods of enforced down time instead of offering zero-cost funding extensions, and not penalising unavoidable “failures” by current projects in future funding application rounds. This will be important in minimising potential project closures, plus staff redundancies or lost income, and associated risk of loss of expertise. Opportunities to diversify revenue sources to increase the resilience of conservation efforts should also be explored (Lindsey et al., 2020). 7. All actors should recognise the role that tropical peatlands, their conservation, sustainable management and restoration will play in both the current COVID-19 pandemic and in the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence; and actively promote this message in fund-raising, education, outreach, community and government engagement, while taking care to tailor messages and associated recommendations appropriately to local audiences (Chua, 2020; Kavousi et al., 2020; MacFarlane & Rocha, 2020; see also Charania & Tsuji, 2012; Chua et al., 2020).

However, we detected a significant association between antibody-positive animals and habitat degradation. Specifically, A. montensis captured in habitats with a moderate level of degradation were 3.68 times as likely to be seropositive to hantavirus as those in the least degraded habitats (95% C.I. = 1.33~11.8) while animals in the most degraded habitats were only 1.88 times as likely (95% C.I. = 0.59~6.47, not significantly different than least degraded habitat) (Table 4). Our field experiments conclusively demonstrate that habitat and landscape composition are primary factors for the prevalence of hantavirus in A. montensis in the neotropics, but not for O. nigripes. We indirectly increased rodent species diversity by adding resources to certain grids (Figure 3A); however, we found no evidence of a dilution effect or of an amplification effect (Figure S1). In our study, there was an increased likelihood of detecting an antibody-positive A. montensis on grids with moderate habitat degradation, but on a fine scale, we detected fewer seropositive A. montensis at stations where fallen trees were present (Cluster 2) and no difference between stations with non-native orange trees (Cluster 3, i.e., most degraded habitats) and stations with a higher percentage of grasses where orange trees were absent (Cluster 1). However, habitat did not influence the probability of hantavirus infection of O. nigripes, at either the grid scale or the station scale. Further, we reported that A. montensis was more likely to be antibody- and/or RNA-positive for hantavirus in “High Forest” habitat [37] and specifically was associated with microhabitat with greater overstory [39]. In summary, these reports demonstrated that habitat type exerts a strong influence on viral maintenance in A. montensis in the Atlantic Forest.

The comparison of incidences with the same lag times independently from deforestation by selecting years randomly did not reveal significant differences, indicating an absence of underlying time trends. However, when assessing the influence of higher deforestation levels on increasing dengue fever incidence during the study period while controlling for other variables, no association could be found. Within the context of this study, the findings support the results of Nakhapakorn et al., who found no association between deforestation and dengue fever in Thailand [38], as well as Saccaro et al., who used PRODES data to examine the effect on deforestation on multiple infectious diseases across the Legal Amazon [40].",NA,"Instead, the findings of the analysis reveal that access to healthcare was the only significant predictor of dengue incidence. Access to healthcare was also found to be associated with socioeconomic markers, namely MHDI, proportion of poor population and income, all of which were correlated with dengue incidence in the bivariate analysis. The associations of the socioeconomic indicators MHDI, proportion of poor population and income with access to healthcare identified in this study further suggest that patterns in reported dengue incidence are primarily driven by surveillance rather than transmission dynamics.","There may further be disparities in the timely fit of data when using deforestation data (assessed mid-year), census data (2010 reports), and climatic data (only available for 2010–2015). Furthermore, there is potential inaccuracy in deforestation levels reported through the forest monitoring system. Finally, this study investigated the influence of deforestation on dengue cases in rural settings, which is less than 3% of all dengue cases in Amazonas. Hence, generalising conclusions from these findings must be drawn with caution as rural dengue incidence only a small proportion of the dengue burden in Amazonas.","To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first analysis of the effect of deforestation on dengue fever in Amazonas, Brazil, using an ecological study design that excludes urban incidence numbers. Moreover, the comprehensive approach of this study is of significant advantage, as most research performed on the burden of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases focused solely on climatic factors or climatic and sociodemographic influences [15, 17, 70]. The findings of this study serve as a starting point for further research by highlighting potentials and challenges as well as indicating areas of future research. Key challenges of an ecological study design are a lack of granularity and conflicts in data harmonisation, especially when using Open Data. More fine-scaled but sufficiently structured temporal and spatial information is needed to disentangle trends and associations of potential drivers of dengue emergence in the Brazilian Amazon, with a focus on deforestation.","Multiple perspectives need to be considered to explore disease dynamics more profoundly, including climate, socioeconomics, urbanisation, and vector distribution [71].

Reforestation can increase biodiversity loss when forest expansion is made at the expense of grasslands, savannas, and open-canopy woodlands (38, 39). Afforestation and forest expansion can then decrease ecosystem services (39). Our results clearly suggest that it is not only forest clearance that is responsible of outbreaks of infectious diseases (42), but also reforestation or afforestation, particularly in countries outside the tropical zone. However, the data used does not differentiate between the different kinds of reforestation: plantation for commodities, afforestation, or abandonment of agricultural lands. Hence, the increase in incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in humans in Italy was explained by the ratio of coppice to high stand forest in Italy with natural reforestation that may favor the abundance of the small mammal reservoirs of tick-borne viruses (43). Similarly, reforestation and rebounding deer populations created ecological conditions for tick vectors and the reemergence of tick-borne diseases in USA (44).","Both zoonotic and vector-borne diseases showed an increase in the number of their outbreaks that appear to be linked with deforestation globally over the period of 1990 to 2016, with vector-borne diseases showing a most dramatic increase over the last years of the period considered. Our results also show a positive association between the number of vector-borne disease outbreaks and the increase in land areas converted to oil palm plantations. Our results find support from the recent study of Gibb et al. (37), which demonstrates how the global land use changes, including forest conversion, may favor zoonotic reservoirs and the risks of zoonotic diseases.",NA,NA,"Several potential biases may limit the analyzes presented in this study. First, the registration of infectious diseases depends on several factors such as expenditure on public health services and the quality of the health surveillance system, which vary from country to country but also from year to year in relation to financial priorities, development aid, private sector participation, among others (2). However, our analysis was limited from years 1990 to 2016 with a noticed improvement in global health surveillance. Second, as already mentioned, the definition of a forest by the FAO (30) does not help to distinguish the different types of forests. Third, there are potential confounding effects of climate change especially on vector-borne diseases such as dengue (51) and other vector-borne diseases.","Several other factors are potential drivers of emergence or of epidemics of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases such as livestock (2, 53), pets (54–57) and trade (58).

Collateral effects of land-use development, particularly the emergence of infectious diseases, must be considered when estimating land-use societal or economic benefits. The increase in hazard in areas of high anthropogenic land-use agrees with recent studies that reported a general pattern at the local scale. In disturbed lands with intensive land-use change, rodent reservoir hosts tend to increase their abundance and richness, whereas non-reservoir hosts tend to decrease [10,30].

By contrast, medium- and low-income countries have more variation in their hazard projections. A sustainable pathway in low-income regions such as Central Africa and Southeast Asia would increase their zoonotic hazard index, which might be owing to the political and economic impacts discussed above.","We acknowledge that our spatial analysis is restricted to a zoonotic hazard index derived from predicting the reservoir status of rodents [25]. Therefore, to account for human risk of rodent-borne pathogen exposure or risk of pathogen transmission is necessary to include different factors such as host density, rodent subspecies, pathogen circulation in a given area, pathogen prevalence, intermediate host populations, landscape structure, and human behaviour, among others [22,91,92]. Also, our study only includes data on species occurrence and co-occurrence in a given area but does not incorporate species interactions, an important factor that can drive pathogen transmission.   First, there is considerable uncertainty associated with land-use change models, which we tried to alleviate by presenting results under contrasting scenarios that capture possible variability. Second, these models are a global representation of potential futures and thus do not capture regional differences that could be more important.","From a macroecological point of view, this study attempted to advance knowledge on the global effects of land-use change on the occurrence of rodents with implications for disease hazard. We anticipate that this information will aid in identifying geographical areas that should prioritize research and monitoring of rodent populations and their parasites, and rodent-borne diseases.

We advocate incorporating such human-induced fine-scale differences in deer space-use, and resulting changes in tick distribution, in future studies on the ecology and management of zoonotic, vector-borne, diseases. Similar to the patterns in deer space-use, questing tick density was much lower near frequently used trails than further away from these trails or near infrequently used trails. In fact, on the highly used trails, the reduction in nymph density near the trails, relative to further away, was as high as 63%. ","Our results indicate that even in areas with very high deer and tick abundance, such as ours, tick numbers can be substantially reduced at fine spatial scales relevant for the risk of contracting tick-borne pathogens by humans. When tick densities are low in places where human exposure is highest, i.e. near hiking trails, tick-borne pathogen contraction risk for humans may be substantially mitigated.",NA,"While our sample locations were all located in zones without hunting and sampling was conducted outside of the hunting season, all deer in our study area are subject to hunting in the designated zones (see Appendix A).","These results indicate that spatial planning of recreation activities may be a useful tool to steer the distribution of ticks and thus tick-borne pathogens.  However, since our results are based on data reflecting processes spanning 1–2 years, longitudinal studies or a repetition of our study would be useful to confirm the robustness of results.","For future research it would be valuable to investigate what level of reduction in deer space-use frequency would effectively lead to decreases in questing tick abundance. This could be achieved by quantifying hosts densities and assessing tick loads on different host species. By limiting recreation activities to hiking trails, managers may be able to maximise fear responses of deer in the vicinity of trails, and thus their effects on tick densities. Furthermore, hiking trails and their use could be promoted in places where ticks pose a potential threat, for example near playgrounds or picnic areas. Additionally, such measures would allow a reduction in the use of toxic DEET repellent and impregnated clothing which may have negative impacts on the environment and human health (Miller et al., 2011; Sudakin and Trevathan, 2003). Yet, it should be noted that we do not recommend an overall increase in recreational use of nature areas, nor an increase in hiking trail density.

For example, howler monkeys A. palliata and A. pigra have a higher prevalence of Controrchis biliophilus in fragmented habitats than in protected or continuous forests, probably because of the proliferation of intermediate hosts. Furthermore, A. palliata presented a higher prevalence of Trypanoxyuris minutus, likely due to the large groups concentrated in forest fragments (TrejoMacias and Estrada 2012). . For instance, the presence of fruit trees along patches and edges attracts not only NHP but also invertebrate intermediate hosts, resulting in a higher prevalence of parasites (Valdespino et al. 2010). Moreover, favorable microclimatic conditions and host availability in edges can also promote the abundance of vector species of pathogens such as Oropuche or Mayaro virus (da Silva Pessoa Vieira et al. 2021).","For instance, the presence of Blastocystis hominis in Alouatta seniculus suggests environmental contamination with human and domestic animal feces containing parasite cysts coming from grassland surrounding forest fragments (Rondon et al.2017)). Similarly, A. caraya and Callithrix penicillata living in fragmented forests surrounded by agricultural lands were positive for the presence of Toxoplasma gondii, probably due to contact with contaminated feline feces (García et  al. 2005; Molina et  al. 2014). Conversely, Zika virus (ZIKV) genome sequences obtained from Callithrix jacchus in Ceará State in Northeast Brazil were 100% similar to ZIKV circulating in humans in South America, and yellow fever cases in humans have been reported simultaneously with fndings of viral infection in NHP, suggesting that NHP could act as reservoirs for these viruses in landscapes shared with humans and domestic animals (Favoretto et al. 2016, 2019; Mares-Guia et al. 2020). In the American continent, the presence of parasites such as Capillaria hepatica and T. gondii has been reported in the bushmeat of NHP species (Van Vliet et al. 2017). However, the risk this practice represents for the transmission of more hazardous agents should not be discarded. For instance, in countries of West and Central Africa, where the bushmeat extraction rates are highest, the consumption of NHP meat and the exposure to fuids during hunting, butchering, or transportation to markets has been a source of several infectious agents, such as Ebola virus (which can remain viable in carcasses for up to 3–4 days) or simian retroviruses (Cawthorn and Hoffman 2015; Kazanji et al. 2015; Maurice et al. 2017). Charismatic animals such as howler monkeys (genus Alouatta), capuchin monkeys (genera Cebus and Sapajus), squirrel monkeys (genus Saimiri), lion tamarin (genus Leontopithecus), and marmosets (genus Callithrix) are often kept as pets in different places around the world, either acquired by legal, illegal commerce or as young orphans.",NA,"To understand how anthropogenic pressures affect primate-parasite interactions, we frst need to know how these associations function in undisturbed conditions. Describing primatological disease dynamics in natural pristine environments is not simple since most of the remaining forested areas in the Neotropics are of diffcult access given their orography, remoteness, and, in most recent times, security concerns. Carrying out such feldwork requires specialized transportation, equipment, and, most importantly, the support of local human communities. When designing a study on primatological diseases, we need to address several questions, such as which is the best strategy to monitor the health of a given NHP species? What type of samples are needed? How do we get those samples? Depending on the collection strategy, in situ challenges may include capture, manipulation, and treatment of animals, as well as handling and transportation of samples, especially when working in remote areas. On the other hand, ex situ challenges deal with the best protocol to process and analyze samples to obtain as much accurate and useful data as possible to assess health and disease risks. Capture and manipulation of any wildlife animal has its risks, and it is our obligation to pursue safe practices and to follow ethical protocols that ensure the protection of primates and handlers. Since many NHP populations are threatened, deciding the appropriate sampling size is not trivial; we need to fnd a balance between gathering enough data and the risk to the target populations. For example, not all disease agents are excreted in the feces, or the genetic material could not be enough to detect their presence. Additionally, distinguishing some parasite species could be impossible only through coproscopic examinations, hindering the diagnostic potential of these tools. Moreover, ecological estimates such as parasite abundance and intensity of infection are hard to obtain when using noninvasive sampling","Greater efforts are needed to monitor understudied endangered species to assess the role of diseases in population declines and identify risk zones. Several Neotropical NHP species tolerate a certain amount of habitat disturbance and use anthropic land covers for different purposes, making human-transformed environments important components of their home ranges and daily activities (Galán-Acedo et al. 2019). It is a priority to develop studies assessing the diversity of parasites and pathogens and the disease dynamics in these anthropic land cover types and across transformation gradients to identify those scenarios that can facilitate the occurrence of spillover and spillback events between humans and the NHP","The accelerated rates of landscape transformation in the Neotropics (Antonelli 2022), the continuous human encroachment into the wild, and the fact that nearly 40% of NHP species are at risk by human-induced threats, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting and pet trade (Estrada et al. 2020), make the monitoring of NHP health, the diagnosis of NHP parasites and pathogens, as well as their transmission potential, research priorities. It is critical to assess the ecological aspects that could alter disease morbidity and mortality, along with the challenges faced by both host and parasites in these modifed ecosystems. Additionally, it is critical to include evaluations on the parasites and diseases in humans and domestic animals living in proximity to NHP, along with the corresponding molecular characterization.

These results suggest that vigorous pursuit of other ecological factors responsible for variation in tick abundance at the property level is warranted.","Further, our observation of a significantly negative correlation between tick abundance and reported encounters of ticks on outdoor pets is directly contrary to our prediction. Unmeasured human behaviors toward pets could be responsible for this latter, unexpected association. For example, if pet owners increase their efforts to protect their pets (e.g., with acaricidal treatments or altering access to the yard) when perceived risk is highest, the expected positive relationship between tick abundance and tick encounters could be undermined or even reversed.",NA,"We did not include the proportion of each habitat type (e.g. proportion of lawn) on a property in our glmm models because our sampling intensity (number of flagging intervals) was proportional to the size of each habitat on a property (e.g. more intervals in a larger lawn). As a result, our probability of detecting ticks (our response variable in these analyses) was potentially confounded by the proportion of a property comprising each habitat type. We urge caution in interpreting this result, however, because of the truncation of land cover data at neighborhood boundaries. Although a correlation between tick abundance and cases of tick-borne disease is expected, several factors can weaken this relationship [10]. First, the shape of the relationship is poorly understood. If the relationship between tick abundance and cases of tick-borne disease is not linear, and particularly if there are sharp thresholds, correlations could be difficult to detect [31]. Second, human behaviors might disrupt a direct relationship between tick abundance and cases of disease. For example, if high prior incidence of tick-borne diseases in an area increases avoidance and self-protective behaviors, the expected correlation could be altered. Third, dissociations between the locations where tick abundance is estimated and where epidemiological outcomes are measured could undermine the ability to detect meaningful correlations.

Here we present two more possible trajectories, which represent only hypotheses within several possibilities. In one possible trajectory (red line in Figure 4), spillover risk increases with restoration. This can happen, for example, in our restoration strategy 2 in low and intermediate forest cover landscapes. In these cases, studies understanding risk behaviours and wildlife exposure should be priority, so that risk reduction happens mostly by avoiding human–wildlife interactions. In another possible trajectory (green line in Figure 4), early stages of restoration may have no effect on the spillover risk, until the forest reach threshold level of structural complexity that allows the species interactions that eventually reduce vector abundances and thus, transmission risk. Performing a forest restoration following strategy 1, where restoration increases the size of forest fragments, the expected outcomes are: (1) landscapes with high amounts of forest cover could present no changes in the transmission risks because they already have a low pathogenicity. (2) Landscapes with an intermediate amount of forest cover could present reductions in transmission risks. (3) Landscapes with low amounts of forest cover could present increases in their pathogenicity. In restoration programs following strategy 2, when restoration increases landscape connectivity, the following outcomes are expected: (1) Landscapes with high amounts of forest cover could present no change in the transmission risk of zoonotic diseases, due to the same hypothesis presented in strategy 1. (2) Landscapes with an intermediate amount of forest cover could present negative effects, boosting contact rates with humans and domestic animals and increasing transmission risk. (3) Landscapes with a low amount of forest cover could present increases in transmission risks by extending forest edges densities and the number of suitable habitats for disease hosts and vectors.

However, after this critical period and with the advancement of the successional stage, species richness increases, and the community becomes more complex, potentially controlling the abundance of vectors and hosts. Far from being a clear outcome, the goal of this model is to raise the discussion about how forest restoration can affect the transmission risk of these diseases. It is also guided by some of the many aspects that can affect these outcomes and should be incorporated into restoration studies.","Monitoring programs should always be implemented to allow for early responses and the implementation of mitigation and control actions.

We found that R. rattus was significantly more likely to be present at urban sites than developing or rural sites and strongly preferred those with human infrastructure. Accordingly, we found that rural animals had significantly lower BMIs than those trapped in locations with higher anthropogenic influence, which may be the result of decreased resource provisioning or reduced lifespan in rural areas. This indicates that some features of the built environment may support pathogen persistence in urban areas, including open sewers, markets, and colocated commercial and residential activity (9). For example, we found that all Leptospira species (and L. borgpetersenii in particular) were statistically more likely to be present at sites with higher anthropogenic activity across the urban–rural gradient and were most frequently detected in R. rattus (9). Unlike R. rattus, S. muelleri was most prevalent in the developing location, which may suggest a preference for disturbed or fragmented landscapes that provide access to both natural habitat and the increased resources associated with human habitation.","As a result, the location, frequency, and intensity of contact between people and urban exploiters/adapters is likely to differ across the urban landscape, as are the implications for zoonotic disease risk. However, human infection occurs through the ingestion of food, water, or soil contaminated with cat feces and the oocysts they contain, which can remain infectious in the environment for up to 1 y in humid conditions (26).","Human infections with T. gondii are frequent in Malaysia, with a seroprevalence in healthy people that ranges from 14 to 30% and varies with ethnicity, sex, age, and socioeconomic status (28).","Although we did not identify any known tick-borne pathogens in this study, the use of select consensus PCR assays for pathogen detection may have restricted our ability to identify important zoonoses already circulating in this area (e.g., Borrelia spp.).","As a result, targeted human serosurveys will be necessary to determine if the pathogens identified in urban rodents in this study are associated with health risks to people.

In conclusion, the most important predictors of infection were the high relative abundance of Haemagogus, and consequently lower mosquito species richness and diversity.  Forested areas are more susceptible to viral circulation due to the higher probability of occurrence of NHP species and primary vector mosquito species that use water in tree holes for breeding [19, 21, 59, 60]. In fact, we found two important clusters of confirmed YFV infections in humans and NHPs in the areas most densely covered by forests, which in RJ correspond to the large forest continuum distributed along the mountain chain of Serra do Mar (Fig. 4 and 5c, rectangles d and e). However, a third cluster was verified in the Médio Paraíba and Centro-Sul regions of RJ (Fig. 5c, rectangle f). It is a mosaic composed of small forest fragments mostly surrounded by pastures (Fig. 5c, rectangle f). This type of landscape, characterized by intermediate levels of forest cover with numerous fragments producing higher availability of forest edges, was recently identified as more prone to the occurrence of human cases in a municipality-level analysis [61].","we show that the majority of PLI in humans are within a radius of 11 km from confirmed YFV epizootics in NHPs. Furthermore, humans become infected when approaching the fragments to rest, plant, harvest, or extract other forest resources. Recently, a correlation between the seasonality of agriculture and the appearance of YFV human cases in Brazil was demonstrated [63]. During planting and harvesting times, people working in agriculture and extractivism, who represent about 45% of the reported YFV cases, are more exposed to contact with the wild environment [63], which together with the dilution effect would help to explain the infection force in these regions with small forest fragments.",NA,"However, the large territorial gap in reports of YFV-infected NHPs between the southernmost border of Espírito Santo and the nearest NHP and human depicted in Fig. 3 highlights the failure of YFV epizootic surveillance. Therefore, it is possible that most of the YFV epizootics have not been detected and reported and/or laboratory-confirmed, which probably contributed to the increase in the distances measured.","For both sets, changes in the relative abundance of functional groups and species composition of vector communities seem to determine not only the possibility of YFV circulation, but also the rate of vector infection and the occurrence of human cases. In this way, future analyses of vector biodiversity and landscape may help to predict areas permissive to yellow fever outbreaks.","Even so, according to our data, strategic vaccination of the population within a radius of up to 25 km from a confirmed epizooty disease would prevent more than 90% of human cases, even in areas without a record of epizootic disease, considered epidemiological silent areas.

For example, we estimated that patchy reforestation, akin to a “land-sharing” strategy, on a small landscape to the northwest of Bogotá, Colombia could increase the risk of all three diseases on average, though much of the increased risk would be borne by individuals living in small urban areas adjacent to the increased tree cover who would be expected to experience higher rates of infection from Ae. albopictus and Ny. darlingi. Alternatively, we showed that a single large contiguous patch of increased tree cover, akin to a “land-sparing” strategy, would decrease average malaria risk, reduce the number of high risk malaria hotspots (Figure 8), and lead to a smaller increase in dengue and yellow fever risk.","We found, for example, that both dengue and yellow fever were highly dependent on human population abundance and less so on the spatial configuration of the landscape, though dengue FOIh increases with urban intensity while yellow fever FOIh is maximized in areas of moderate urban intensity and high tree cover (Figure S13). In contrast, we estimated that malaria was highly dependent on the spatial configuration of urban area and tree cover, and that human risk of malaria peaked at the interface of urban areas and forest when there was a high variance in tree cover (forest edge and not large, high density swaths of forest).",NA,NA,"Though we conducted an extensive literature search for each model parameter, we often failed to find quantitative estimates that would allow us to parameterize relationships between urban intensity or tree cover and transmission-related quantities like mosquito abundance. Further, given a lack of sufficiently detailed mosquito blood meal data, we used a simplified representation of mosquito feeding behavior.","Further empirical work on the feeding preferences of these mosquitoes would help to improve model estimates. However, it may also be possible to circumvent these data limitations if a time series of spatially explicit human disease incidence data is available (e.g., from health centers spread across the focal landscape).  First, any parameter calibration would require human disease notifications recorded spatially over time, such as from a detailed health surveillance system. Second, even with these data in hand, a modification may have to be made to link reported cases to R0 and FOI. Further, a few additional model caveats will be important to keep in mind. First, we assumed a simple Gaussian spatial pattern of movement of the infected host around a “home” landscape cell. If movement of the infected host or vector is more complicated (such as an infected human moving long distances along a road, between a few specific focal points of interest, or alternatively a sick individual not moving at all; e.g., see Stoddard et al. 2013, Kennedy et al. 2016), spatial FOI patterns could look very different (e.g., much flatter across the landscape if movement is much wider, or more patchy if movement is lower). We also assumed that the infected individual’s availability to mosquito feeding is constant over their infectious period, which is a simplified version of infection dynamics.","In the meantime, we suggest that the model could be used as a tool for analyzing uncertain phenomena and forming hypotheses for future testing (Baker et al., 2018). For example, we have shown that the model can provide an early expectation for the broad range of effect sizes that various reforestation strategies could have (Figure 8). It can also be used to examine more nuanced patterns, such as the prediction that in the presence of both an urban-breeding mosquito and a forest-breeding mosquito that both prefer biting a host that dwells primarily in one landscape area (which are represented here by Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and humans), the FOIh attributable to each mosquito will be inverses of one another leading to a peak in infection risk at intermediate host population density.",,NA,,,,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

This is probably due to changes in the vegetation cover that favour adaptable species, such as A. jamaicensis. In bats captured on islands classified as small, isolated (Meyer et al. Reference Meyer, Fründ, Lizano and Kalko2008; Guava, Guanabano), trypanosome prevalence was higher than in bats sampled on islands classified as larger or less remote (Leon, Cacao) and on the mainland sites. Our finding that trypanosome prevalence in A. jamaicensis was negatively correlated with the number of bat species supports the concept of the dilution effect (Ostfeld and Keesing, Reference Ostfeld and Keesing2000b; Keesing et al. Reference Keesing, Holt and Ostfeld2006; Vaz et al. Reference Vaz, D' Andrea and Jansen2007). Fragmentation also causes changes in habitat conditions, i.e. forest composition and cover (Leigh, Reference Leigh1999; Tabarelli et al. Reference Tabarelli, Cardoso da Silva and Gascon2004) which are likely to affect trypanosome prevalence in A. jamaicensis. Compared to the mainland, the islands with the highest trypanosome prevalence (Guanabano, Guava), are covered by large numbers of palm trees, in particular Scheelea zonensis and Oenocarpus mapora, (Leigh, Reference Leigh1999). Those palm trees are preferred roosts of A. jamaicensis (Handley and Morrison, Reference Handley, Morrison, Handley, Wilson and Gardner1991; own observations) and harbour vectors of trypanosomiasis, particularly assassin bugs (Triatoma, Reduviidae) (Gaunt and Miles, Reference Gaunt and Miles2000; Aufderheide et al.

It could be that some intrinsic factors on the part of the bat, such as age, are more important for the prevalence of Litomosoides, but we need to learn more about the natural history of this haemoparasite before firmer conclusions can be drawn. Especially in times of ever-growing human impact on ecosystems and global change it becomes even more important to have a grasp on fundamental factors affecting emerging diseases (Travi et al.

At the 250 m scale the trends are less obvious but the hexagons have a more homogeneous landscape within. This is simply caused by the smaller surface of the smaller hexagons.",Although suitable tsetse habitat is still present in all fragmentation classes it is expected that its degree of fragmentation affects the movements of tsetse flies in their quest for food. All factors (especially habitat fragmentation) hindering those seasonal movements of the flies will thus have direct repercussions on the flies’ feeding success and their survival. The effect of those changes in apparent fly density on disease transmission requires further investigation.,The approach presented in this paper may form the basis for rationalizing area-wide tsetse fly control activities by identifying areas where tsetse flies are likely to disappear as a result of autonomous clearing and where control may not be required and identifying areas where tsetse flies are likely to persist and where control is thus more appropriate.,Medium,Medium,,Low,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

","In 2007/08 we had the largest NE outbreak recorded in Sweden so far, with 1483 human cases (Olsson et al. 2009, Khalil et al. 2014b). The outbreak was associated with adverse weather and harsh snow conditions in winter, thought to trigger bank vole behavior to enter human dwellings more than normal and thereby increasing human contacts with infectious voles. However, it was also suggested that this extreme outbreak could have been related to higher PUUV prevalence, and implicitly higher IL in the bank vole population than in the early 1980s (Olsson et al. 2009)",NA,"However, it must be noted that the infrequent sampling (twice per year in spring and fall) used in our study system can influence the interpretation of vole and disease dynamics. However, as we do not know the fate of individual voles over winter, we could not determine whether these habitats were mainly “dead-ends” or contributed to virus transmission in the bank vole population.","By analyzing more recent samples from the ESB (see above), studies are now under way to explore whether PUUV prevalence, distribution and IL in the bank vole population have increased in our study area since the 1980s (this study; Niklasson et al. 1995) and, if so, may be related to relaxed predation on bank voles by the Tengmalm's owl, and to a relaxed dilution effect from the grey-sided vole population and/or changes in logging pressure.",NA,Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

Review,Web of science,10.1098/rstb.2016.0125.,Does deforestation promote or inhibit malaria transmission in the Amazon?

Distinguishing between initial deforestation for human settlement and ongoing deforestation in already established areas is likely to be critical to properly understand how deforestation relates to malaria risk.  Barros et al. [40] describe the forest fringe as a unique ecotone where larvae tend to cluster, serving as a potential source of malaria vectors. These authors found significantly more An. darlingi larvae in forest fringes than in primary forest or deforested sites. Thus, increasing the distance to these transitional zones is expected to lower the risk of contact with malaria vectors. Barros & Honório [13] also reported the absence of An. darlingi larvae from open sunlit deforested landscapes, and where forest cover was experimentally removed above and around water bodies, larval clusters disappeared. Forest clearing exposes mosquito larval habitats to sunlight, subsequently reducing larval populations of certain species [2,40].","Fifteen per cent of papers in our review (7 of 47) report that forest-related activities (e.g. land clearing, logging, extraction of forest products, hunting and fishing) increase human contact with malaria vectors leading to a rise in malaria cases, but only 57% of these (4 of 7) collected survey data to test this relationship [16,19,56,57]. The association between forest-related activities and malaria is supported by Bauch et al. [45], who found that strictly protected forest areas promote lower malaria transmission, while sustainable-use protected areas are associated with higher malaria transmission. On the other hand, Barros et al. [58] and Silva-Nunes et al. [19] found no evidence that activities like hunting or fishing, which involve sleeping away from home (outside), increase malaria risk.Second, people visit different LULC categories at different times of the day and spend different amounts of time in each place. As a result, exposure to different mosquito species varies considerably and HBR per se might not be enough to determine the primary malaria vector. For instance, HBR might be high in agricultural fields based on night captures but that may be inconsequential if people only visit their agricultural plots during the day. Similarly, people may spend so much time in their villages at night that, despite the lower HBR, this LULC category is where most malaria transmission occurs. Finally, some people sleep under bed nets at home but readily expose themselves to mosquitoes when going fishing or hunting at night in secondary/primary forest. ",NA,NA,"Studies that integrate entomological and epidemiological data are critical to understand how environmental changes (e.g. deforestation) influence malaria vectors and how these changes ultimately impact malaria risk. Unfortunately, these studies are still relatively rare, comprising 21% (10 of 47) of the papers in our review.","An ideal study would devote significant effort to understanding the environment, vectors and humans and how they interact. In relation to the environment, a good characterization of different vegetation types (e.g. degraded forests, secondary and primary forests, etc.) and types of water bodies (e.g. fish ponds, streams, hoof prints) is critical. The monitoring of multiple mosquito species and life stages (i.e. larvae and adult mosquitoes) is also likely to be important in generating a more mechanistic understanding of how the environment influences mosquito populations. Besides examining larval habitats, entomological studies should pay close attention to characterizing mosquito resting sites, as this is an often cited (but under-studied) mechanism through which vegetation influences adult mosquito presence. As for humans, assessing malaria prevalence is likely to require cross-sectional surveys where all individuals are tested with very sensitive and specific diagnostic methods (e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR)).  Longitudinal epidemiological studies employing active surveillance would be especially useful for elucidating the temporal dynamics underlying ecological change and malaria transmission. Finally, the monitoring of human behaviour (e.g. movement patterns) will also be crucial in relating malaria risk to LULC and entomological findings, and new technologies such as GPS loggers [85–87] are likely to be play an important role in minimizing recall bias.",Medium,,Low,Low,High,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

Lower disease hazard was observed at benches and trails at forest edges. This infrastructure effect can be attributed to variation in vegetation characteristics and the habitat use of tick hosts, specifically roe deer, rodents and songbirds.

NIP of different pathogens was affected by different drivers. Lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in the interior of forest stands, driven by its most prevalent genospecies B. afzelii, points towards higher density of uninfected hosts there. B. afzelii was positively associated with understorey containing tall species and with high canopy cover, whereas local bird community composition predicts B. garinii prevalence.

It may, for example, be more desirable to assign a recreational purpose to forest stands with less developed shrub layers or more open canopies. They are expected to harbour less (propagation and larval) hosts and therefore ticks. From a similar point of view, focussing visitor flows at edge trails rather than trails in the forest interior will considerably lower TBD hazard. For green spaces where such planning is not possible or desirable, our results allow to better estimate TBD risk and plan small-scale management efforts accordingly. Depending on the ecosystem service that is prioritized within a zone, the local management strategy may be attuned to reduce TBD risk: areas where high tick densities and recreational pressure are expected may warrant repeated management that focuses on contact rate reduction or visitor sensibilisation. Given the small scale nature of the observed effects, we consider it relevant to apply management efforts to green space infrastructure where visitors are exposed, even if it is not desirable to apply them to the entirety of the surrounding forest stand.

This could lead to an increased prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in questing nymphs, and, unless tick control measures are put in place, increased densities of infected ticks and an increased risk of Lyme borreliosis. Indeed, a study from central France found a higher prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in I. ricinus collected from woodland habitat compared to adjacent pasture [86]. Similarly, a study from Scotland found densities of infected I. ricinus nymphs (a measure of the risk of Lyme borreliosis) to be five times higher in woodland compared to adjacent open habitats [34]. An association between a higher prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in questing ticks from semi-natural mixed/broadleaved woodlands compared to coniferous plantation was found in surveys from northern England and Scotland [19,20]. This was suggested to be due to higher densities of bird and rodent transmission hosts in semi-natural woodlands compared to plantations. However, a third study from Scotland did not find a difference in prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. or risk of Lyme borreliosis in semi-natural mixed/broadleaf woodland compared to coniferous plantations, indicating the difficulty in generalizing between broad habitat types [66].  Natural regeneration of woodlands is often limited by grazing herbivores, particularly deer [77]. It is therefore generally essential to cull deer or exclude them by fencing in order to protect new saplings for the creation of woodlands, as described in §2 of this paper (figure 2). If large herbivores are successfully excluded from regenerating woodlands, this should mitigate the otherwise predicted increase in tick abundance and the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Increasing woodland cover without long-term strategies for deer management could lead to an increased usage of woodlands by deer, increased tick populations and elevated Lyme borreliosis risk.",NA,"Urban areas are home to many wildlife tick hosts including increasing numbers of urban deer and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) [115,116], but also dogs and cats which can provide an abundant host for the nymphal and adult tick stages [36]. The proportion of ticks feeding on dogs and cats which are able to return to habitat that could support their development is unknown; however, it is likely that some engorged ticks will find suitable habitat to develop a subsequent generation. Dogs and cats may also carry ticks into human homes and increase human–tick exposure. Higher temperatures in urban areas compared to surrounding rural areas may also affect tick development rates [117,118] and tick–host interactions.  More recent research in cities in Southern England have investigated tick density and the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in more typical urban greenspace such as small parks, vegetated pathways, housing estates bordering woodland, urban grasslands managed as meadows, as well as woodlands within urban settings. Higher tick densities were found in urban woodlands or localities (e.g. parks, grasslands) adjacent to woodland, particularly on the urban fringe. Seasonal variation in B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence and tick densities was found and high B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence rates of up to 30% were detected in some of these habitats [37] compared to a mean of 7.5% in woodland habitat from outside urban areas in England [20]. ",NA,NA,"There is significant uncertainty in the effects of some of these types of management considered in this review on Lyme borreliosis risk due to a lack of empirical studies. Land use management actions are essentially large-scale ecological experiments, which are otherwise rare and difficult to conduct. As such they provide unique opportunities to gain mechanistic insights about ecological interactions relevant to disease transmission [140].","For example, where biodiversity monitoring is conducted to measure the success of conservation projects such as woodland regeneration or restoration, tick surveys and pathogen testing could be incorporated as part of these studies. As the cycles of many vector-borne pathogens occur in nature, interdisciplinary collaboration between veterinary and human public health scientists with stakeholders in conservation and forest management is needed to assess and minimize these environmental hazards [10,141]. Although conservation management decisions will necessarily consider many factors, we suggest that inclusion of vector-borne pathogen dynamics and mitigation should be part of environmental impact assessments [142]. In line with efforts in relation to managing habitats for mosquitoes [142], further research on how conservation management impacts Lyme borreliosis risk would inform best-practice guidelines for practitioners in how to manage woodlands accessible by the public in order to minimize the exposure of people to infected ticks. This could include guidelines on environmental management to minimize the hazard from ticks, for example by managing the height of ground vegetation close to paths [13]. Another important measure would be to provide appropriate risk messaging about ticks and tick-borne diseases, with surveys to assess the effectiveness of these measures [79].",Medium,,Medium,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

Furthermore, deforestation increases the risk and incidence of malaria, representing a considerable impact on malaria epidemiology. Here we corroborated that deforestation (as defined herein) is a substantial risk factor for malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, mainly when it occurs by clearcutting areas of 5 km² or less. Therefore, decreasing the deforestation rate could be an effective measure for controlling malaria in Brazil49. Furthermore, the new landscape delineated by the pattern of deforestation and soil occupation may favor dispersal of Ny. darlingi by creating forested areas interspaced by deforested areas, which are linked by forest corridors along the igarapés and shaded dirt roads such as those observed in Machadinho D’Oeste, Rondônia state, Brazil by Castro & Singer30. Our major finding of a highly significant correlation between malaria incidence and patch size <5km2 indirectly supports the hypothesis that large deforested areas, with patches of exposed land and degraded forest larger than 5 km², are not favorable to Ny. darlingi, a vector that uses the forest edge for maintenance of its immature forms26,54. Barros et al.33 verified that malaria was correlated with shorter distances to potential transmission hotpots and people living within 400 m of such hotspots had a 2.60 higher risk of malaria.",NA,"Decisions and delimitation of areas that will be used to develop and start a new rural settlements are undertaken, as a rule, in the absence of specific projects capable of generating income, improving socioeconomic growth and wellbeing, or promoting environmental sustainability of the rural communities involved55. It appears that localization of malaria cases and areas of deforestation are highly sensitive to Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC), a phenomenon that occurs when agricultural activities are transferred from one region and reconstituted in another56. Arima et al.57 observed that displacement of cattle breeding, due to agricultural expansion, lies behind changes in land use in municipalities hundreds of kilometers away. This is driven by land speculation, a search for basic supplements such as wood for fences or house construction, migration and a demand for labor. Thus, both deforestation and malaria may be being determined, in part, by distant events.","It is important to highlight the actions of malaria control by the Brazilian Health Secretariat (vector control, active case detection and treatment and distribution of mosquito nets), which may have contributed to the decreased number of malaria cases in 2015. However, such a determination was beyond the scope of this study, because these activities are inconsistent and shift according to changing government policies and priorities, and available municipality budgets (for example, actions to combat dengue fever reduce malaria control activities in rural areas)51. Our results verified that malaria increases along with deforestation, following the seasonality of the Amazon, driven by the rainfall regime. The latter is also an important environment component for the spread of Ny. darlingi52. Therefore, the annual data were not significantly correlated between malaria and the deforestation variables, because annual data hide the seasonal pattern, which is very marked in the Amazon. The driest months were associated with the largest deforested and impacted areas and the greatest numbers of malaria cases. Our findings strongly corroborate those of Kirby et al.53 who discovered that localities in the Amazon with the least rainfall and longest dry seasons were consistently more prone to deforestation, compared to those with heavier annual rainfall and shorter dry seasons. One apparent discrepancy in our findings was that April 2011 registered a large impacted area (2,074 km²), though the number of malaria cases that month was smaller (15,267 cases) than that of the previous month (March/2011: 16,615 cases). The most likely reason for this apparent discrepancy is that a greater number of patches >5 km² accounted for the smaller number of cases in April, i.e., only 8% of the total number of polygons accounted for 62.8% of the total area impacted. This observation reinforces the role of small patches in malaria epidemiology.","Despite recent advances in vaccine development71 and the effective treatment of malaria with new drugs and techniques72, vector interventions, adequate planning of land use and occupation, and promotion of the minimum conditions necessary for the generation of income for the subsistence and financial autonomy of humans living in the Amazon, are sadly lacking and need to become a priority to prevent forest ecosystem failure and further public health discrepancies.",NA,Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

The picture that emerges illustrates that vectors of human pathogens are more abundant in deforested than forested areas, whereas non-vectors display the opposite tendency. The evolutionary advantage for the adaptation of zoonotic vector-borne diseases to deforested habitat is less clear. Examining the host preference for such mosquito species that are more abundant in deforested habitats, it becomes apparent that many of these feed on livestock (e.g. Culex sp. vishnui subgroup, Culex fuscocephala, Culex gelidus, Aedes vigilax, Anopheles subpictus) (Amerasinghe & Amerasinghe 1999; Samuel, Arunachalam, Hiriyan, & Tyagi 2008; Jansen et al. 2009). Thus conversion of forest to agricultural land may bolster zoonotic diseases utilizing cattle, swine, or poultry as hosts. ",NA,NA,"There were several challenges encountered in synthesizing the literature on mosquito abundance by deforestation. The mosquito sampling strategies varied greatly by study, and included human landing catches (Harbach et al., 1987, Overgaard et al., 2003, Vittor et al., 2006, Diallo et al., 2012), light traps (Sithiprasasna et al., 2005, Steiger et al., 2012, Thongsripong et al., 2013), chemical lure traps (Thongsripong et al. 2013), resting adult mosquito aspiration (Thongsripong et al. 2013), larval collections (Sithiprasasna et al., 2005, Minakawa et al., 2005, Mushinzimana et al., 2006, Cox et al., 2007), and a variety of experimental designs (Cox et al. 2007; Munga et al. 2006; Afrane et al. 2007). Another bias may have been introduced by sampling at a single elevation. All of the adult mosquitoes sampled in these studies were collected at ground level (approximately up to 1.5 m). In forest habitat, some mosquito species are canopy dwellers (Andrews et al., 2014, Lord et al., 2016), and these would therefore also be underrepresented in this data set. The different ways in which land use and land cover were determined and classified in these studies posed another challenge.  ","The seemingly low number of studies that met the inclusion criteria (n = 17) is a startling reflection of how few studies have actually measured vector abundance in forested and deforested areas, highlighting the need for future studies in areas where deforestation rates are highest (southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa). However, the association between deforestation and mosquito-borne diseases is far from uniform or certain. Incorporation of ecological theory (such as metapopulation theory and landscape ecology) and evolutionary perspectives would expand our understanding of the dynamics that drive changes in mosquito species assemblages. Given the rapid pace of global land use change and deforestation, it is imperative that these dynamics are better understood to mitigate disease risk and guide land use policy.",NA,Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

Our evaluation of alternative spatial scales identified strong associations for deforestation within a 30 km radius around villages but not for deforestation in the near (10 km) and immediate (1 km) vicinity. This study’s results echo the frontier malaria hypothesis from the Amazon region, which posits an increase in malaria incidence in the first few years following deforestation and a decrease over the long term. However, we found an earlier inflexion point, 1–3 years after deforestation compared to 6–8 years in the Amazon (de Castro et al., 2006), most likely because of very different underlying human processes.","Engaging in forest activities, such as logging, hunting or spending the night in the forest, has been reported as a major risk factor by many studies in the region. Our results suggest that deforestation in dense forests (Table 3) around villages, particularly areas further from the village (Table 1), is a driver of malaria in Lao PDR. We argue that this is indicative of the existence of a key high-risk group linking the deforestation patterns identified to malaria in the villages, namely a forest-going population. Deforestation captured by remote sensing in this setting likely reflects locations and times of heightened activity in the forest areas near villages, and therefore greater human-vector contact. ",NA,"First, reliability of such records varies across and within countries of the GMS and may depend on malaria incidence level. This could lead to unmeasured residual confounding, further exacerbated by the lack of available data on malaria control activities in the region. Another challenge with these data is obtaining an accurate denominator for incidence, as not everyone attends a public health center when febrile. We addressed this issue by modeling the probability of seeking treatment as a function of travel time to the closest health facility using data from two cross-sectional surveys. Last, the village-level geo-referencing of malaria registries ignores the possibility that patients may become infected elsewhere. Unfortunately, these surveillance records did not include information about patients’ forest-going trips. Research to track and analyse micro-scale movements of forest-goers is needed to understand how they interact with the forest and where are the foci of infection. The forest data we used has also been criticized, in particular for not distinguishing tropical forests from agroforestry (Tropek et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2014) or man-made from natural causes of deforestation. The lack of temporal resolution for the forest gain variable (2000–2017 aggregate) as well as the assumption that forest loss happens all in 1 year are additional limitations of these data. Finally, our relative measure of deforestation, key to consistently compare the effects across different spatial scales, also implies that a 0.1% of the area that experienced forest loss within 30 km of a village is a much larger area (∼280 hectares) than within 1 km (∼0.3 hectare) and should be interpreted cautiously.",,NA,Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

The analysis does not prove any causal relationship between these land-use attributes and virus transmission to humans but highlights the existence of a remarkable co-dependence pattern among different risk factors in areas where horseshoe bats occur.","In China, meat supply is largely reliant on domestic production using imported feed (for example, soy from the Americas)36, which explains the high livestock density in many rural areas, including those at the forest margins. Indeed, about 94% of meat consumption is contributed by domestic production (96% for pig meat, 92% for poultry, 94% for mutton and goat, 80% for bovine meat). Likewise, economic growth and the shift to diets richer in animal products explains the increasing demand for wild animal meat delicacies, increasing human–wildlife interactions through multiple pathways and the disturbance of forest habitat in more remote locations—frequently abroad—through trade-related connections37. China is also undergoing major urbanization trends, with a ~24.6 × 103 km2 increase in built-up land between 2010 and 2015 at the expense of cropland, woodland and grassland38.",NA,"The bat location data and species distribution data also suffer from different, but related, issues to the virus data. The bat location data are presence-only data. True absence data are difficult to obtain, and therefore we randomly sampled within different locations to generate pseudo-absence data. Choosing from where to sample from also presents difficulties, and therefore we chose horseshoe bat distribution data for species that existed within China and East, South and Southeast Asia. This presents further issues because the distribution of one species, the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), encompasses Western Europe, North Africa, and Central and East Asia. We therefore weighted our sampling based on the number of overlapping species distributions to account for this. However, these species distributions are large polygons and the realized niches used within them by the species probably differ; therefore, better niche models using presence and, ideally, presence–absence data are required to develop better predictions of species presence33. However, our results for random locations in China and outside China and reported bat observations were comparable, suggesting the results were insensitive to these changes. Land-use change and climate change may change their distributions in the future. Here we limit our analyses to data reported since 2000, but future analyses may be needed to better capture location and distribution changes.",NA,NA,Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

Second, our model assumes no directionality between the units (i.e. outcomes of a pair of connected municipalities are observed contemporaneously). Although that situation may not occur for an infectious disease, it serves as a reasonable model, given the lack of precise data on person-to-person infection.","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply causal inference methods to estimate the effects of deforestation on VL. Despite growing awareness that the emerging occurrence and dynamics of infectious diseases may be associated, at least in part, with deforestation, relatively few studies have investigated whether and how deforestation might play such a role [21]. Our poor understanding of the relationship between infectious diseases and anthropogenic environmental changes could be due to several factors. One is the high cost of data collection inherent to studies of natural ecosystems. A second factor is the poor quality and/or dearth of data about the prevalence of the various components of infectious disease cycles, including vector, human, and wild host reservoirs; and misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and underreporting of disease cases. A third, and likely most important, obstacle to understanding the impact of deforestation on infectious disease occurrence is the use of methodologies that do not benefit from recent advances in causal inference for complex and large-scale systems [21,25,57].

Our results from the univariate regression analyses suggested that the landscape variables related to develop-space (class 21–23) generally had opposite effects on the risk change in the two regions, with positive associations in Upper Midwest and negative associations in the Northeast. n the Upper Midwest, decreasing forests, particularly deciduous forest, might be correlated with more contacts of human to forests and ticks, thus can increase human Lyme disease risk. In addition, evergreen forests (class 42) and mixed forests (class 43) generally had negative effects on Lyme disease risk, which was consistent to several previous studies assuming that these forests might be poor environments for ticks regarding to temperature and precipitation as they were generally located in mountainous areas [26].",NA,NA,"We must admit that the Lyme case number obtained from CDC might be an underestimate of actual human cases. Particularly, different states may apply different approaches to gather case data. Including state as a random effect in our analyses was able to control for, to some extent, the differences in surveillance way among states. In addition, we admit that other socioeconomic (e.g., human behavior) or biotic factors (e.g., tick density, host community composition, etc.) could be also important in determining human Lyme disease risk. However, due to the lack of landscape-scale data of these factors, we could not control for these factors. Finally, this study focus on the correlations between Lyme risk changes and predictors, and may not disclose the causality underlying the detected relationships, we thus suggest future studies could explore the underlying mechanisms with more field data, such as the fluctuation of rodent density or tick density.","With increasing high-resolution land cover data and advances in remote sensing techniques, scientists have been showing more and more interest in exploring the roles of landscape factors on pathogen transmission [41,42]. We consider our approach could be applied in the future studies which try to map the risk of infectious diseases using landscape metrics.","As this is a correlation analysis which cannot disclose the causality for the detected relationships, we suggest future studies could explore the ecological mechanisms underlying the correlations we found, by collecting detailed field data such as rodent and tick density.",Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE

The adjusted regression coefficients for deforestation were negative and statistically different from zero for all Brazilian Cerrado states. It is also important to highlight that the residuals of the fitted models do not show spatial dependence. In this study, the loss of native vegetation and the increase in dengue cases measured between 2001 and 2019 are prevalent in Mato Grosso, São Paulo, and Mato Grosso do Sul. These states showed a significant trend of vegetation loss for the evaluated time series, with an inflection point in the years 2008, 2010 and 2008, respectively.",NA,NA,"Some limitations of our study should be taken into consideration. First, we performed only time series analysis without considering the factors that affected the occurrence of dengue and deforestation, such as separation of incidence of dengue cases in urban and rural populations, climatic and socioeconomic variations (e.g. social inequality, per capita income, Human Development Index, GINI Index, GDP). Second, since the National System of Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) was created in 1993, and the Ministerial Ordinance that regulates and creates the national list of compulsorily notifiable diseases was published in December 1999, we could only obtain data from 2001 to 2019. It is also worth noting the possibility of underreporting in reported cases of dengue, due to several factors, mainly due to asymptomatic cases and the failure to seek medical care. More data can improve the effectiveness of the PGLM adjusted for each state of Brazilian Cerrado. Third, this study focused only on the Cerrado biome. Whether these models are suitable for other epidemic locations or other infectious diseases requires further and robust study, as well as the use of other model prediction methods such as Ecological Niches Modeling. It is known that climatic variables (e.g. high temperatures and rainfall) favor the ecology of the vector (A. aegypti) and the spread of the disease [21]. However, we believe that these variables can be incorporated in future studies. It is also worth noting the existence of underreporting dengue cases in the country, either mainly due to the distance of rural populations to health units, or the characteristics of these populations, and even to the increase in other diseases as has been happening with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which the health system of several states has collapsed, making arboviroses such as dengue less evident.","As seen in the cluster analysis, there was clustering in different groups, which reinforces the idea that there is a need for public health and environmental policies directed to each region because it is a vast geographical region.","To reduce the incidence of dengue cases in the Cerrado, Brazil will need to implement public health, environmental and social policies, requiring a joint effort by all spheres of society.",Medium,Medium,,Medium,Medium,AF,High,TRUE,FALSE
